** [#A] Questions
*** Why community want to switch from heapster to metric server?
- Heapster serves the API using go http library which doesn't offer a number of functionality that is offered by Kubernetes API server like authorization/authentication or client generation. ([[https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/instrumentation/metrics-server.md#scalability-limitations][link]])

In Kubernetes 1.12, heapster will be tenatively removed. In 1.13, it will be moved to kubernetes-retired organization. ([[https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster/blob/master/docs/deprecation.md][link]])

Consider using metrics-server and a third party metrics pipeline to gather Prometheus-format metrics instead.
*** How I can send my pod/application metrics? Metric server won't be a good idea?
** k8s monitoring architecture
- a per-node agent and a cluster-level aggregator [[https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/instrumentation/monitoring_architecture.md][link]]
** Metric Server
*** Basic Intro
It will be a cluster level component which periodically scrapes metrics from all Kubernetes nodes served by Kubelet through Summary API. Then metrics will be aggregated, stored in memory (see Scalability limitations) and served in Metrics API format. ([[https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/instrumentation/metrics-server.md#design][link]])
**** local notes                                                   :noexport:
Resource Metrics API is an effort to provide a first-class Kubernetes API (stable, versioned, discoverable, available through apiserver and with client support) that serves resource usage metrics for pods and nodes.

- metric server is sort of a stripped-down version of Heapster
- The metrics-server will collect "Core" metrics from cAdvisor APIs (currently embedded in the kubelet) and store them in memory as opposed to in etcd. 
- The metrics-server will provide a supported API for feeding schedulers and horizontal pod auto-scalers
- All other Kubernetes components will supply their own metrics in a Prometheus format

Metrics Server is a cluster-wide aggregator of resource usage data. 

Metrics Server registered in the main API server through Kubernetes aggregator.

The metrics-server will provide a much needed official API for the internal components of Kubernetes to make decisions about the utilization and performance of the cluster.

- HPA(Horizontal Pod Autoscaler) need input to do good auto-scaling

| Name           | Summary                                                           |

| Core metrics   | node/container level metrics; CPU, memory, disk and network, etc. |
| Custom metrics | refers to application metrics, e.g. HTTP request rate.            |

Today (Kubernetes 1.7), there are several sources of metrics within a Kubernetes cluster
| Name           | Summary                                                             |

| Cadvisor       | a standalone container/node metrics collection and monitoring tool. |
| Kubernetes API | does not track metrics. But can get real time metrics               |
*** Limitations
- Metrics Server supports up to 30 pods per cluster node. (From [[https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/metrics-server][link]])
- Assume to collect up to 10 metrics from each pod and node running in a cluster (From [[https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/instrumentation/metrics-server.md#scalability-limitations][link]])

** Cadvisor
Cadvisor monitors node and container core metrics in addition to container events.
It natively provides a Prometheus metrics endpoint
The Kubernetes kublet has an embedded Cadvisor that only exposes the metrics, not the events.
** heapster
Heapster is an add on to Kubernetes that collects and forwards both node, namespace, pod and container level metrics to one or more "sinks" (e.g. InfluxDB). 

It also provides REST endpoints to gather those metrics. The metrics are constrained to CPU, filesystem, memory, network and uptime.

Heapster queries the kubelet for its data.

Today, heapster is the source of the time-series data for the Kubernetes Dashboard.

An easy introduction about k8s metric server. (It will replace heapster)

https://blog.freshtracks.io/what-is-the-the-new-kubernetes-metrics-server-849c16aa01f4

> All other Kubernetes components will supply their own metrics in a Prometheus format

In logging domain, we can say `syslog` is the standard format

In metric domain, maybe we can choose `prometheus` as the standard format.

** Metrics Use Cases
https://github.com/kubernetes/community/blob/master/contributors/design-proposals/instrumentation/resource-metrics-api.md

https://docs.giantswarm.io/guides/kubernetes-heapster/

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Horizontal Pod Autoscaler: It scales pods automatically based on CPU or custom metrics (not explained here). More information here.
Kubectl top: The command top of our beloved Kubernetes CLI display metrics directly in the terminal.
Kubernetes dashboard: See Pod and Nodes metrics integrated into the main Kubernetes UI dashboard. More info here
Scheduler: In the future Core Metrics will be considered in order to schedule best-effort Pods.

* Kubernetes Monitoring: prometheus, heapster                      :noexport:
https://deis.com/blog/2016/monitoring-kubernetes-with-heapster/
https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/prometheus-developers/3zq4oD7if3s

Since we're extending heapster in various ways for auto-scaling, and
we're about to add support for collecting and aggregating custom
metrics, we should decide and document what the boundaries for
heapster's responsibilities should be. In particular, I don't want it
to grow into a general-purpose application and/or infrastructure
monitoring, dashboarding, and alerting system, such as
Prometheus. There are many such systems, and we shouldn't compete with
them.

#+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
Heapster is a competing monitoring system.

 * Heapster is limited to Kuberenetes container metrics, it is not general use.
 * Heapster only provides metrics back as REST, it does not have a query language. (atleast that I could find)
 * Heapster does not have any form of alerting.
Basically, if you have Prometheus, there's almost no reason to use heapster.
